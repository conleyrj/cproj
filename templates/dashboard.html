                    <h5 class="card-title">Which demographic factors (e.g. household size, presence of children, income) appear to affect customer engagement?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      There are several demographic factors that have potential to influence a customer's interaction with the store and product. 
                      For this example, we are examining how demographic factors may show a correlation between a customer's attitude towards 
                      products with an organic label, marked by the NATURAL_ORGANIC_FLAG. The demographic factors we have chosen to focus on are 
                      age and income range, marked by the AGE_RANGE and INCOME_RANGE attributes respectively. We ignored null values for these 
                      attributes because they could represent any age or income range.
                      For the purpose of simplicity, we are choosing to examine these attributes separately from one another, first let us look 
                      at a customer's age. Counts of products with a value of 'Y' for the organic flag were grouped by age range and then averaged. 
                      From the following visual representation of these results, it appears that younger households purchase more organic product. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="text-center">
                      <img src="/static/images/graph.png" width="50%" class="rounded" alt="...">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      But it is important to consider that younger households could be larger in size, and generally just tend to purchase more 
                      products of all types because there are more people. To normalize this data, the number of all products purchased was all 
                      calculated by using the same queries, but without the filter for organic products. The ratio of organic products purchased 
                      to all products purchased was then calculated for each age-range.
